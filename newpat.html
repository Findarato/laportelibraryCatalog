Thank you for applying for a La Porte County Public Library temporary card! 

You may use your temporary card to search the library's databases and place
holds on library materials. You will need to create a PIN to log into the databases.
To do this simply go to the My Record feature on the library's catalog page and
follow the steps there. 

If you want to use your card to check out books, music CDs, DVDs, video games
or use the public computers at any of our locations you will need to get a regular
library card.

To do this, simply go to any location of the La Porte County Public Library and
request one. You will need to bring a current picture ID and proof of your address
with you.  Acceptable forms of ID include a driver's license, a passport, or
matricular ID. If you are under the age of 14, you will need to come with a parent
or guardian to get your regular card. 

Your temporary library card number is
